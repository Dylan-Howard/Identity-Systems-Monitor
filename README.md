# Prognosis: Identity & Access Monitor
Prognosis is an identity & access monitor--a comprehensive application designed to provide granular visibility and control over user identities across multiple systems. By integrating with our HRMS (System of Record) and target systems (e.g., Google Workspace, Entra ID, OneRoster REST API), Prognosis offers a unified view of user accounts, their associated metadata, and educational data aligned with OneRoster 1.2 standards.

By offering insights ("gnosis", knowledge in Greek) necessary for proactive measures ("pro", beforehand in Greek), Prognosis received its name.

## Key features include:
* Centralized User Management: Streamline user account management through a single interface, including generating passwords, resending onboarding notifications, and unlocking accounts.
* Data Synchronization: Ensure data consistency across systems by facilitating forced synchronization between the HRMS and target systems.
* In-depth Analytics: Gain valuable insights into user account data across various systems through detailed reporting and analytics.
* OneRoster Compliance: Review and export educational data in accordance with the OneRoster 1.2 standard.

## Tech Stack:
* Frontend: React-Admin framework, custom React components
* Backend: .NET, C# for data synchronization service and REST APIs
* Database: Microsoft SQL Server

IAM empowers organizations to streamline identity management, enhance security, and ensure data integrity.
